# ERC20-Texonia

Solidity is an object oriented programming language used for smart contract writing.ERC20 is a protocol standard that defines certain rules and standards for issuing tokens on Ethereum's network. In this project, I wrote my own ERC20 Token using solidity and followed these steps while doing it.

1-I created a metamask address for myself via my browser extension.
2-I sent 1 test ether to my metamask account at https://faucet.ropsten.be.
3-I created my own token at https://remix.ethereum.org with solidity.
4-I scanned the coin from https://ropsten.etherscan.io.
5-I uploaded the coins to my account by entering the Translation hash of the coin I created from the create private coin option in Metamask.
